====== LibSVM supported filetype classification ======

This document describes how to use these libraries. It is recommended to use
libsvm classification only in case "cheap" methods (e. g. signature checking)
do not work. 

===== Installation procedure =====

  - Install libsvm from project directory
http://forensics.nwt.fhstp.ac.at/repos/libsvm-3.12-openmp.tar.gz

  - Extract and then build the library
$ cd libsvm-3.12-openmp/python
$ make

  - More information about multi-core CPU support can be found here
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/faq.html#f432

  - Especially the OMP_NUM_THREADS variable is worth a view (example: quad-core CPU)
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

===== How to use these tools =====

  - Create two directories: one contains training files and one contains the test files
$ mkdir /tmp/training
$ cp some.mp3 /tmp/training
$ cp some.jpg /tmp/training

$ mkdir /tmp/test
$ cp someother.mp3 /tmp/test
$ cp someother.jpg /tmp/test

  - Set PYTHONPATH environment variable to let Python find libsvm python bindings (compiled in previous step)
$ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/src/libsvm/python

  - Extract features from training files set (results in /tmp/training.txt.model and /tmp/training.txt.range)
$ ./svm-extract.py /tmp/training 4096 > /tmp/training.txt

  - Extract features from test files set
$ ./svm-extract.py /tmp/test 4096 > /tmp/test.txt

  - In libsvm/tools directory start generation and testing of SVM model:
$ ./easy.py /tmp/training.txt /tmp/test.txt

  - Back in this directory, test the results of your training run
$ ./svm-test.py /tmp/training.txt.model /tmp/training.txt.range /tmp/test/03-aloe_blacc-hey_brother-loutcho.mp3 4096
