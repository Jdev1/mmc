### MM Carver Framework Invocation ###
# Rainer Poisel (rainer.poisel@fhstp.ac.at), 03062011

# Preamble

This framework has been tested with Debian GNU/Linux only. But it
should also work with Ubuntu Linux and other .deb based distributions. 

# Starting the framework

As the python script requires some external libraries (and wrappers which are
also available as shared objects) running the framework requires some
environmental variables to be set. The following line has to be executed in
order to start the framework:

$ ./mm_carver --help

Here is a short execution example:

$ ./mm_carver -f /tmp/practical.floppy.dd

# Caveats

Starting the framework without compilation (see INSTALL) results in the
following error message:

$ ./mm_carver -f /tmp/practical.floppy.dd
Error: __init__() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)
